## Problem Statement
In the context of our consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers, the primary challenge we face is to make informed loan approval decisions based on the applicant's profile while mitigating two critical risks:
* If we decline a loan to an applicant who is likely to repay, it results in a substantial loss of business opportunities.
* Risk of Default: Conversely, if we approve a loan to an applicant who is likely to default, it may lead to significant financial losses for our company.
To address these challenges, we have access to historical data on past loan applicants and their repayment behavior, specifically whether they 'defaulted' or not.

## Business Objective:
* The objective of this case study is to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to gain a deep understanding of how various consumer attributes and loan-related factors influence the likelihood of loan default.
* Our ultimate goal is to identify meaningful patterns, insights, and relationships within the data that allow us to:
* Predict the likelihood of loan default accurately.
